## Pokemon App

This app is similar to my Lord of The Rings app but with some added features. Current features include: displaying all pokemon and fetching their data upon request.

## Roadmap
In the coming days I will add similar functionality for moves, items, and berries. As with my lord of the rings app this is a way for me to learn react so after I get a few more projects under my belt I will return to this one and subsequently judge and improve 
any areas that need fixing (since this is my second ever project in react I am willing to bet there will be quite a few!).
